What do we want to add to the website?
  Alumni connection page
  Extra merch page?  (if we have extra pices of clothing from rush, class hoodies, etc. we can sell them here)
  - i like this idea
  
What do we want to keep?
  Welcome page with the video.  
      Create a way for people to upload clips/videos that can be shuffled?
  Brothers page
      If we can easily get access to all composit photos, we can update the brothers page
  sweetharts page
      needs updating
  Rush
      maybe we can use this more for when rush happens?
      - agreed; probably have rush video on home screen during fall rush week

What do we want to upgrade/improve on?
  Burger menu is wack 
  search bar not easilly accessable
      make fixed position at bottom or top of the screen
  loading cat
      just why??
  Style of website can use a revamp
  responsiveness of screen size changes is a bit slow
  - also ensure screen sizes of all pages look good on mobile
  Integrate our instagram posts onto the website

Biggest challenges
  creating a way to allow others to update/change the website without having to constantly update code
  - yeah a thread/post system where users can make posts/comments/likes
    - risky since the website is public lol
  creating accounts for alumni/actives?
  - agreed i thought of this too; make a login and assign usernames and passwords to actives, alumni can ask us for accounts
  with accounts, we can have parts of the website that are only accessible to alumni/actives
  - family trees
  - facebook integration
  - party details
  - download links to files
    - rush interest forms
    - nicknames spreadsheets
    - info sets 1-4
